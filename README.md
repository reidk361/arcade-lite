## Description
  This is a simple Tetris App made using only React. It interfaces with a MongoDB database and queries using GraphQL through an Apollo server.  
  We use a separate site to host the database and it's used to store scores from the leaderboard. 

## How to Play
  Here's the link to the deployed site:
  [Arcade Lite](https://arcade-lite.herokuapp.com/)
  * You click the start button to start the game.
  * You use the left and right arrow keys or buttons to move the pieces left or right.
  * You press the down arrow or button to make the pieces fall one more space. 
  * When you get a whole row filled, is disappears. 
  * For each row that disappears, you get 100 points.
  * If the pieces reach the top of the board, you lose. 
  * When that happens, enter your initials and see where you're placed on the leader board!
  * **(Optional)** Change between the retro and modern themes using the Set Modern/Retro button.
